## What is this project about?

Aposcar is a website where you and your friends can guess the winner of each category in the Oscar, 
and see where you stand among another players and your friends as well.

### Features

- See all the Oscar Nominations and winners
- Create your profile to guess the winner for each category
- Create and join rooms with your friends to get a custom rank

### Why?

This project actually started as a joke. A few months before the Oscar 2020, me and my friend had the idea to bet who could get more winners right.
We called some other friends and made it a personal game of ours. So last year we had the idea of making it more a serious thing, 
so other people can participate with their friends.
